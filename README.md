An AI model to predict autism in infants based on the pupil trejectory of the kids. The idea is to make a scanpath by tracking the pupil movements in front of a moving object and then classifying that scanpath as autistic or non autistic. 
opencv was used for tracking the pupils
convolution neural networks were used to classify the scanpaths.
